     =========STEP BY STEP TO GREATE .GITIGNORE FILE==========
__________________________________________________________________

1. Navigate to Your Project Directory
First, you need to navigate to your project directory (C:\DUNIS_PROJECTS\buz_owners) in your bash terminal. Hereâ€™s how you do it:

cd /c/DUNIS_PROJECTS/buz_owners

2. Activate Your Virtual Environment (If Needed)
source venv/Scripts/activate


3. Create .gitignore File
 # touch .gitignore : this is a command to create .gitignore file


4. Add Files and Folders to Ignore

file.txt :      to ignore a files named file.txt or any files at all.

# Ignore the virtual environment folder
venv/ :         To Ignore a Specific Directory  you add a slash at the end:

# Ignore Python cache files
__pycache__/ :      To Ignore a Specific Directory  you add a slash at the end:

# Ignore environment variables
.env:           Ignore a Hidden File: To ignore a hidden file like .env

# Ignore log files
*.log:          Ignore All Files with a Certain Extension To ignore all .log files


#------Understanding .gitignore Patterns:--------#
    i. Ignore the Virtual Environment Folder:  venv/
    ii. Ignore Python Cache Folder:  __pycache__/
    iii. Ignore Log Files:  *.log
            This * log pattern tells Git to ignore all files with a .log extension. Log files are 
            often generated during runtime and are not necessary for version control.
